    <div class='my-story'>
        I started my programming journey by making games in my spare time, I discovered that I liked programming more than the welding job I had 
        at the time.
        <br>
        <br>
        I always rushed home from work anxious to work on my own games. I knew that programming was what I should be doing, not welding.
        So I endeavored to become a full time developer.
        <br>
        <br>
        My motto as a developer is "It doesn't matter how much you know now, what matters is how much you can figure out." I can do anything, given that I take the time to learn it.
